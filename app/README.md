# Spacee Mars Rover Photos - WebApp

## Build
First, install dependencies: 
```npm i```

Then, build the bundled application:
``` npm run build ```

## Run
You can run the app locally or in the included Docker container.

To run locally: ```ng serve```

To run in docker: ```docker-compose up --build```

The --build option tells docker to build the container before running it. If you have made no changes to the application,
you can leave off that option.
